His exploits include the cleansing of the Augean stables so as to earn a tenth part of a cattle of the sun, the catching of the Stymphalos birds, the temporary capture of Cerberus (The hound of Hades), and picking the golden apples of immortality. Herakles became the god-ancestor of the Dorian Kings. Alexander the Great had an image of him incorporated into his coinage. According to one legend, Deianeira caused Herakles's death in a fit of jealousy with a robe tainted with the poisoned blood of a centaur from one of his arrows. It inflicted so much pain that he immolated himself at Mount Oita. In a conflicting myth Herakles slew his wife and children at Thebes.</div>

The son of Jupiter and Juno, he is one of the major deities on the Roman pantheon and the patron of all soldiers. He was particularly popular in Roman Britain. He is depicted wearing a suit of armor with a plumed helmet. He bears a shield and spear. His retinue includes Metus (Fear), Deimos (Dread), Phobos (Alarm), Eris (Discord), and Pallor (Terror). Mars is frequently linked with Bellona, the minor Roman war goddess who drives his chariot. He took an active role in the primordial war between Gods and Giants. His consort is Venus and he is the Father of Harmonia, Cupid and Anteros. He is also romantically linked with the vestal Ilia, who was burried alive for contravening the laws of her sisterhood. Through Ilia Mars fathered Romulus, the alleged founder of the city of Rome, and Remus, who was slain by Romulus. It was the convention that a Roman general, before setting out for combat, would invoke Mars in his sanctuary.</div>

He is generally depicted as a rather grotesque figure with one leg shorter than the other, a deformity gained as a result of being hurled to earth by Jupiter while trying to protect his Mother from the God's wrath. Therafter he determined to shun the company of other Gods and set up a home in Mount Etna, where he fashioned a cyclopes. He created a golden throne for Juno and he fashioned both Jupiter's magical thunderbolts and Amor's arrows. He enjoyed short term relationships with various Goddesses, including Venus and Minerva, and with one of the Graces. His offspring seem generally monstrous.</div>

                    <div class="description">Aphrodite is one of the major Goddesses of the Greek Homeric pantheon, according to legend born as a cosmic deity from the foam of the ocean after her father Ouranos was castrated by Kronos and his genitals were hurled into the sea. In other accounts she is of a younger generation, a daughter of Zeus. She is the consort of Hephaistos and occasional mistress of other deities, including Ares. Through liaison with the herdsman Anchises she bore Aeneas who is said to have carried his father to safety on his back during the sack of Troy. Aphrodite possibly evolved from the Phoenician or Mesopotamian model of a goddess of love and one of her strongest early cults was on the island of Cyprus. In some contexts she is depicted as being androgynous and occasionally a beard (see Artemis). As the Mesopotamian predicessors she is a goddess of war and victory. The nearest predicessors to the Helenic model seem to be present in the Mycenaean period particularly as the Kition sanctuary. In the Iliad, Aphrodite rescues Paris from his fight with Menalaus and returns him to the arms of Helen of Troy. In Hellenic art Aphrodite is particularly drawn wearing fine clothes and jewelry.She possesses a girdle with magical properties.

                    <div class="description">One of the major Greek deities. He is always depicted as a God who epitomizes youthful masculinity, possibly with early links to Lycia in Asia Minor (Hittite) and to Minoan Crete. Generally a distant rather than intimate and approachable God. His Mother is Leto who wandered the world in great suffering until she chanced on the island of Delos where she found refuge, and Apollo is often portrayed as part of a triad with Leto and Artemis. He epitomizes the transition between adolescence and manhood in Greek male society. At Delphi his sanctuary is central to the complex. At Delos it appears secondary to that of Artemis. The paean dance of healing which is particularly known from the Hyakinthia festival at Amyklai (Sparta) is closely identified with the Apollo cult. Not only is he a god of healing but also of pestilence. He is the Father of Asklepios, the God of healing, and he is continually associated with purification rites and oracles. Generally Apollo is drawn as a God of hunters carrying a bow and arrow. He became the patron God of poets and leader of the Muses (daughters of Zues). Literature often presents Apollo in a dual aspect of fearsome hunter and gracious lyre player. In the former capacity he was mericless, killing the many children of Niobe who boasted of them to the chagrni of Leto. He fought and slew the Delphic Python and the Olympic cyclopes, but in both cases himself became subject to general laws of morality and suffered temporary banishment.

As a warrior God he is contrasted with the more prominent and successful Goddess Athena who fought and vanquished him in a war between the Gods. Although Athena stands for victory in battle through glory and honor, Ares epitomizes the evil and more brutal aspects of warfare. In the eyes of Zeus he is "the most hateful of Gods." His war chariot is pulled by Phobos (fear) and Deimos (terror). Ares' sons were even more barbaric than him. Kyknos was a ferocious killer who, until slain by Herakles, was proposing a temple constructed of human skulls. Another notorious son of Ares was the dragon slain by Kadmos as he sought to found the city of Thebes. Its teeth, which he sowed in the earth, germinated and sprang up as warriors, the grandsons of Ares, who promptly turned on each other in mortal combat. Ares entered into a brief liaison with Aphrodite, the goddess consort of Hephaistos, and through her father a daughter, Harmonia, whom Kadmos later married, thus paving the way to establishing Thebes in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.

                    <div class="description">Artemis is a deity of very ancient origins who survived and attracted great popularity in both Asia Minor and Greece into Christian times, when arguably much of her ethos was transferred to the Virgin Mary. Both figures enjoyed major sanctuaries at Ephesus. As an Asiatic Goddess Artemis was often drawn winged and standing between wild animals. In this context she generally appears equipped with boots, a torch and a pointed cap. She is also a strongly androgynous figure, a feature depicted dramatically in the statue of Artemis of Ephesus. Her temple at Ephesus dates from the fourth century B.C. and is ranked among the seven wonders of the world.</div>
                    <div class="centers">Horn altar at the Sanctuary in Delos; Pisidia, Antioch; Magnesia, on the Maeander; Pamphylia; Perge; Ephesus</div>
                    <div class="celebrations">The cult statues were carried in procession on May 25th among a congregation of up to 30,000 people. To the Greeks she was the daughter of Zeus and Leto. She was honored in the sanctuary on Delos with its celebrated Horn altar from 700 B.C. In Greek mythology the androgynous aspect was firmly discounted. In her earliest pre-Homeric form the Mistress of Animals "suckles the young of every wild creature that roams the fields." As a huntress she uses a bow and arrows. By Homeric times the ferocity of this prehistoric element has waned in favor of a more timid image of a young girl dominated robustly by her stepmother Hera. A contrary character study in the Odyssey pictures her more positively as a virgin Goddess chasing and killing boars and hinds over the hills and fields, fleet of foot and in company with a band of nymphs. She presides over nature and over the initiation rituals ofyoung girls. She is also a goddess of blood sacrifice. A cruel element emerged in a different sense as she threatened any maiden who turned to the role of wife. Paradoxically, and more in keeping with the old semetic personality, she is also the goddess of birth.

                    <div class="description">Displays a complex personality which may be the result of syncretization in prehistoric times between a Goddess of Vegetation and death. In ancient Athens the dead were titled demetreioi and corn was traditionally scattered on new graves. Demeter undergoes a yearly conflict with Hades and a search for her lost daughter, or arguably her alter ego, since the personality of the missing maiden goddess Persephone or Kore (girl) is virtually inextricable from that of Demeter. The legends of Demeter and Persephone account for seasons of dearth and growth in the fields. Persephone, daughter of Demeter and Zeus, gathers flowers in a meadow surrounded by attendant Okeanides. As she picks one particular bloom the earth opens and the underworld God, Hades, abducts her. Demeter searches the world for her daughter and neglects its prosperity in so doing. The Gods, seeing that catastrophe beckons, intervene and Hermes is sent to fetch the girl. There are conditions attached to her release, however, because she has tasted the pomegranate of Hades and is thus bound to the underworld. She may only enter the air above for nine months of the year. For the remaining three she must return and live as mistress of Hades. One of the most reasonable interpretations of the legend is that the three months when Persephone or Kore is in absence represent the three dry summer months when vegetation in the Mediterranean region shrivels away and when traditionally the grain was stored in underground silos. When the rains come in autumn the youthful aspects of Demeter returns. There are strong parallels with Mesopotamian and Hittite-Hurian legend (Inana and Dumuzi; Hebat and Telepinu). The Demeter cult was practiced in many places, often with a high degree of secrecy and with initiation rituals.

He has a retinue of male phallic satyrs wearing animal masks and joined by female maenads. Although a gigantic phallus was carried in rituals honoring Dionysos, he is not a fertility God and the phallic symbolism is purely that of sexual arousal and carousal. Dionysos is the son of Semele and there is some argument that the cult originated in Phrygia or Lydia linked to that of Kybele and traveled via Mycenaean culture with sanctuaries in Pylos and Keos. Greek women traditionally worshiped dionysos. It is possible that the Roman name Bacchus is of Semitic origin, meaning wailing (see Tammuz). Other authors have suggested that the personality of DIonysos emerged from Thrace and extended to Homeric Greece but this argument is now out of favor. Other than in the opening of the Homeric epic material. Dionysos scarcely appears in literature.</div>

                    <div class="description">Gaia is an ancient pre-Hellenic goddess who was mainly revered in Attica. She
                    is the primordial essence of the earth, one of the creations of Aether and Hedera, the primordial beings
                    of the cosmos. Through the encouragement of Eros she became the Mother of Pontos (sea) and Ouranos (heaven).
                    According to tradition, through liaison with Ouranos, she also engendered the race of Titans. By consorting
                    with the underworld she created the monstrous Typhon. Perceived as a placid and resilient goddess generally
                    with some apathy to the goings-on around her in the tale of beginnings. She had an oracle at Delphi that predated
                    that of Apollo. Gaia was later superseded by other divinities, but she maintained a role presiding over marriage
                    and the taking of oaths. In the Iliad, Agamemnon cries to Zeus: "May Zeus, all highest and first of the gods, be
                    witness first, then Gaia and Helios and the furies underground who punish men for having broken oaths." In Hellenic
                    times Gaia became Da-meter or Demeter, the corn mother whose daughter is Kore, the corn spirit.

                    Hades, are identified in the Odyssey as lying beyond the ocean at the edge of the world and in the Iliad as lying directly beneath the earth.
                    Through Hades runs the river Styx, beside which the gods made their hallowed oaths, and Lethe, with its waters of forgetfulness. In the
                    Odyssey the rivers are identified as Piriphlegethon and Kokytos (a tributary of the Styx) both of which flow into the Acheron. Hades abducts
                    Persephone (Kore), the daughter of Demeter, and brings her to the underworld to reign as his queen for four months in every year. He is
                    depicted as a dark-bearded god carrying a two-pronged harpoon or a scepter, and a key. He may be called Plutos, although the latter is
                    generally regarded as a distinct deity.

                    <div class="description">In his Catalogues of Women Hesiod, the Greek contemporary of Homer and author of the definitive Theogony
                    of the Greek pantheon, confounds traditions by making Helen the daughter of Zeus and Ocean. Other Greek authors contemporary
                    with Hesiod give Helen's Mother as Nemesis, the Greco-Roman Goddess of justice and revenge, who was raped by Zeus. The mythology
                    placing Helen as a demigoddess identifies her Mother as Leda, the mortal wife of Tyndareus, also seduced by Zeus who fathered
                    Pollux as Helen's brother. However Hesiod strongly denied these claims. Homeric legend describes Helen's marriage to King
                    Menelaus of SParta and her subsequent abduction by Paris, said to have been the catalyst for the Trojan War. After her death,
                    mythology generally places her among the stars with dioscuri (sons of Zeus), better known as Castor and Pollux, the twins of the
                    Gemini constellation. Helen was revered on the island of Rhodes as the Goddess Dendritis.</div>

On Rhodes, allegedly the site of the largest Greek statue of a deity, the so-called Rhodes "Colossus" cast in bronze, there was a celebrated festival of Helios during which a chariot with four horses was driven off a cliff, symbolizing the setting of the sun into the sea.</div>

                    <div class="description">As the long-surffering, but also jealous and quarrelsome, wife of the philandering and all-powerful god Zeus, Hera
                    adopts a position in the Greek pantheon that is at times ambiguous. The relationship with Zeus is incestuous since she is also the eldest
                    daughter of Kronos and therefore Zeus's full sister. Mythology views her both as an independent and wilful senior Goddess, and as a tragi-comic
                    figure. Her marriage involved a degree of subterfuge, persuading Zeus by means of a magic girdle momentarily to forget his preoccupations with
                    the Trojan War. In another piece of legend Zues turns himself into a cuckoo so that he may fly into Hera's bosom. Who seduced whom thus remains
                    ambiuous. Curiously, neither in literature nor in art is Hera perceived as a Mother Goddess. She seems to have borne only a limited number of
                    Zeus's named children. The most prominent is Ares, yet he is also the least favored by the God. Other minor offspring included Hebe and Eileithyia.
                    Hera relates to Zeus in three distinct "phases" - consummation in which she is paid the girl; wedding and fulfillment as teleia; and separation
                    when she becomes Chera. As stepmother to Zeus's illegetimate children, Hera displays a jealous and malicious charater, directing her anger at Herakles
                    and Dionysos in particular. In a fire festival practiced in Boeotia to the "great Daedala," wooden images were burned to enact a legend whereby Plataea,
                    one of Zeus's concubines, was stripped naked, humiliated, and immolated by a jealous Hera. During a New Year festival, the Heraia, to honor
                    Hera, her priestesses were carried to the sanctuary on a cart drawn by oxen which also presumably contained a statue of the Goddess.
                    Traditionally a women's games festival dedicated to Hera was also held on Olympus every four years.

According to legend Hermes as a day-old infant stole the cattle of his elder brother Apollo while playing a lyre. Legend accords to him the invention of fire, also generated on his first day. Hermes's skills at theft were put to use by other gods of Olympus, who sent him to liberate Ares from a barrel and to bring King Priam of Troy into conciliatory meeting with the Greek war hero Achilles after the death of Hector. Classical art depicts Hermes wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the kerykeion. He is reputedly the only being able to find his way to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again. Hence he was sent to bring both Persephone and Eurydice back from Hades. In company with other Greek Gods, Hermes is endowed with not-inconsiderable sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs and with which he also maintains a healthy and thriving population of sheep and goats. He was often represented in wayside shrines in the form of a phallic pillar or post which was regarded as a funerary monument, hence the role of grave guardian.

One of the daughters of Kronos and Rhea, her adherence to the fireside prevented her from joining the procession of gods described in Plato's Phaedra. On oath she remained a virgin following the notion that fire is phallic and that she was wedded faithfully to the sacred hearth fire. By tradition Greek girls tended to the household hearth. Hestia was conventionally offered small gifts of food and drink.</div>
